## Use
The Grow a Garden API runs locally on your own server / desktop.

You can access it via ```http://localhost:11560/```

The default port for this API is ```11560```, why? No reason, just the port I came up with at the time of creating this.
If you need to use a different port, use this command in place of Installation step 4:
- ```npm start -- --port=YOUR_PORT```
